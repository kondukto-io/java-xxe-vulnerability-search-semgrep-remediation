> **Vulnerable Java repository: Javulna**

## Overview

This repository aims to demystify Java XXE vulnerabilities, offering both theoretical insights and practical remediation tactics. We use the Java repository `edu-secmachine/javulna` for hands-on exploitation and remediation demonstrations.

## Repository Structure

- [assets](./assets): Contains screenshots for the research
- [codes-of-scenarios](./codes-of-scenarios): Houses the case scenarios, remediation, and exploitations
- [remediated-for-both](./remediated-for-both): Features code remediated for both rules and results

## Static Analysis with Semgrep: A Docker-Integrated Approach

We employ Semgrep for static analysis. The following command initiates the scan:

\```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/src returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config p/owasp-top-ten --json -o /src/semgrepscan-results.json
\```

## Exploitation with XXE

The image below showcases the terminal execution, revealing a successful XXE exploit.

## Anatomy of the XXE Exploit

The XML snippet responsible for the XXE attack is broken down as follows:

\```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
\```

- XML Declaration: Specifies the XML version and encoding.
- DTD: Defines the XML structure and is pivotal in this attack.
- XML Content: Houses the root element and invokes the malicious entity.

## Remediation: Securing XML Parsing in Java

Here's a snippet showcasing the remediation code:

\```java
DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
\```

---

## Alternative Strategies

- Use OWASP's ESAPI
- Disable DTDs
- Implement strict schema validation

---

## Bonus: Semgrep Limitations

Post-remediation, Semgrep still flagged the code as vulnerable, suggesting the need for rule updates.

---

## Differences between Remediations/Rules

The false positives generated by static analysis tools can lead to unnecessary time expenditures and security risks.
